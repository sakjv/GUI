Project: GUI Progress Bar Controlled by Console 

Objective 

Design a C++ application that combines a console interface with a GUI progress bar window. The goal is to simulate a process that updates progress visually, allows cancellation, and communicates the result back to the console. 

Shape 

Requirements 

Console Application 

Displays a simple menu:  

Start Process 

Exit 

When the user selects Start Process, a dummy process begins:  

Simulates progress from 0% to 100% over time. 

Updates a GUI progress bar. 

Can be cancelled by the user via the GUI. 

Progress Bar GUI 

A separate window that includes:  

A visual progress bar. 

A Cancel button. 

The window should:  

Appear above the console window when the console is active. 

Not stay on top of other applications (i.e., not globally “always on top”). 

Clarification: Window Behavior 

The progress bar window should behave like a child or dependent window of the console. This means: 

When the console window is active, the progress bar window should appear above it, making it visible and interactive. 

When the user switches to another application (e.g., Chrome), the progress bar window should not remain visible—it should go behind the other application windows, just like the console does. 

When the user switches back to the console, the progress bar window should reappear above the console, allowing the user to interact with it again. 

This behavior ensures the progress bar is helpful without being intrusive.

Functional Requirements 

updateProgress(int percent): Updates the progress bar. 

closeWindow(): Closes the progress bar window. 

isCancelled(): Returns true if the user clicked Cancel.

Implementation Guidelines 

1. Console-Based Host 

Start with a console application that displays a simple menu: 

1. Start Process 

2. Exit 
The user should select “Start Process” from the console to begin.

AI-generated content may be incorrect. 

2. Separate GUI Window 

When the process starts, launch a separate GUI window for the progress bar. 
The GUI should include: 

A progress bar showing 0–100%. 

A Cancel button to stop the process. 

The GUI window should behave like a child of the console window: 

Appears above the console when the console is active. 

Does not stay globally on top of other applications. 

When the console loses focus, the GUI should go behind other windows. 

Use child-parent window linking (e.g., Win32 SetWindowLongPtr or equivalent) so the GUI is logically tied to the console window. 

4. Threaded Process 

Run the simulated process in a separate thread. 
Update the progress bar from this thread. 

5. Cancellation & Feedback 

If the user clicks Cancel, stop the process immediately. 
After completion or cancellation, report the result back to the console (e.g., “Process completed” or “Process cancelled”).

Submission Instructions 

Please submit the following: 

1. Executable 

Provide a standalone executable that can run on a clean Windows machine without requiring an installer. 

To avoid issues with missing dependencies:  

Statically link the runtime libraries  

Or, include any required DLLs in the same folder as the .exe. 

2. Source Code 

Include all relevant source files, headers, and project files (e.g., .cpp, .h, .vcxproj, .sln). 

Organize the code in a clear folder structure. 

Add a short README.txt or README.md explaining: RT 

How to build the project. 

Any dependencies or build instructions. 

Which GUI framework (if any) was used. 

3. Design Document 

4. Packaging the Submission 

Zip the entire project folder (including the executable and source code).
